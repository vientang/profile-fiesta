# profile-fiesta
Create a social profile and save your favorite links where others can what you've bookmarked.

##What I'm working with
1. React
2. Redux
3. Node
4. Express
5. MongoDB
6. Web scraping

##Getting Started
####Before Getting Started, install Node on your machine
1. Clone the repo from your Github account to your machine. 
2. CD into profile-fiesta directory and run the following commands:
  - npm install (installs all of the dependencies needed)
  - npm run build (to build webpack and watch for changes)
  - npm run start (runs nodemon. You can npm i -g nodemon or change the script to node)

##Roadmap
v1.0 Build out the CRUD operations, set up Redux store to manage state, make a web scraping tool to populate bookmarks with meta data, set up simple log in flow, hash passwords and verify users with JWT.
